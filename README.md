# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

![Just click the "Generate Password" button and my script will output a random password that meets your needs.](./Assets/javascript-homework-screencap.png)

It has its flaws, but if you want a random password this script well get the job done. In order to guarentee that each selected character type makes it into the password, I ended up making it so that generated passwords aren't truly random. Will work out a solution and resubmit, but what I have right now works well for what it does.
